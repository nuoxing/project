<h1>FindBugs FAQ</h1>

<p> This document contains answers to frequently asked questions about
<a href="index.html">FindBugs</a>, a bug pattern detector for Java.

<h2>Q1: I'm getting java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError when I try to run FindBugs</h2>

<p> FindBugs requires JRE 1.4.0 or later to run.&nbsp; If you use an earlier version,
you will see an exception error message similar to the following:
<pre>
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError:
edu/umd/cs/findbugs/gui/FindBugsFrame (Unsupported major.minor version 48.0)
</pre>
The solution is to upgrade to JRE 1.4.0 or later.

<h2>Q2: When I click the "Find Bugs!" button, I get a NoSuchMethodError</h2>

<p> The symptom of this bug is that when you start the FindBugs analysis,
you see an exception similar to the following:
<pre>
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.bcel.Repository.setRepository(Lorg/apache/bcel/util/Repository;)V
        at edu.umd.cs.findbugs.FindBugs.clearRepository(FindBugs.java:483)
        ...
</pre>

<p> The problem here is that the wrong version of the
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/">Apache BCEL</a>
library is being found.&nbsp;
There are (at least) two possible reasons this is happening.

<p> First, if you install the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/webservices/downloads/webservicespack.html">Java(TM) Web Services Developer Pack 1.2</a>
in the <code>lib/endorsed</code> directory of your Java Runtime Environment (JRE).&nbsp;
The file <code>xsltc.jar</code> contains an old version of BCEL that is incompatible with
FindBugs.&nbsp; Because jar files in the <code>lib/endorsed</code> directory
take precedence over those in the application, there is no easy way to
fix the problem except to remove the offending jar file.&nbsp;
A workaround is to move these Jar files
into a different directory, and use the <code>java.endorsed.dirs</code> system
property to specify the new location for programs that require these files.

<p> The other possibility is that you are using the IBM JDK.&nbsp;
Some versions include a version of BCEL which conflicts with the
one required by FindBugs.&nbsp; This problem is fixed in version 1.4.1 SP1,
so upgrading your JDK should allow FindBugs to run correctly.

<p> Many thanks to Peter Meulmeester for identifying the problem
with the Web Services Developer Pack, and to Michael Levi for reporting
the problem with the IBM JDK.

<h2>Q3: FindBugs is running out of memory, or is taking a long time to finish</h2>

<p> In general, FindBugs requires lots of memory and a relatively
fast CPU.  For large applications, 512M or more of heap space may be
required.  By default, FindBugs allocates 256M of heap space.
You can increase this using the <code>-maxHeap <i>n</i></code> option,
where <i>n</i> is the number of megabytes of heap space to allocate.

<p> Version 0.6.9 of FindBugs introduced new types of analysis that
improve precision, but require more memory and time to perform.
In version 0.7.0 and later, you can disable these analyses by
adding the <code>-conserveSpace</code> option to the FindBugs
command line.  E.g.:

<pre>
   findbugs -textui -conserveSpace -xml -project myProject.fb -outputFile out.xml
</pre>
